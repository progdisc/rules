## Rules

1. Follow the Discord service guidelines: <https://discordapp.com/guidelines>
   
2. This is a welcoming community. All forms of abuse, belittlement, and
   rudeness are strictly forbidden. This includes unsubstantiated
   language/technology bashing, unprompted aggression, and anything unpleasant
   that someone else asks you to cease.

3. Memes and shitposts are not allowed outside of #off-topic, and they are
   discouraged in general. Excessive meme/shitpost spam will lead to a kick/ban.

4. Post your questions directly if you want help, without fear. Please do not
   ask for explicit permission; that is unnecessary and forces people to wait
   for your return. 

5. Please try using a search engine before asking your question. While we try
   to help everybody whatever their question, there are many answers on the
   Internet and you may not need live help.

6. Everyone on this server is a volunteer. We forbid monetary offers outside of
   job listings in #hire-people, which has very strict rules.

7. We do not help with breaking the law or breaching any software, API’s or
   Terms of Service.

8. Do not post or discuss NSFW/NSFL or illegal content (this includes
   nicknames).  Do not post or discuss piracy content. Do not post or discuss
   political content.

9. No advertisement (invite links, referral links, etc.) unless explicitly asked,
   in which case links can be sent through personal messages.

10. If you are having trouble deciding which channel to post in, choose whatever
    is closest. We are lenient about channel separation because everyone is in
    every channel.

11. Post your question in one and only one channel before waiting for a
    response.<br>
    Cross posting will not get you an answer sooner, and it will split the
    discussion into redundant and/or conflicting answers. Directing people to
    your question is a better strategy than reposting it.

12. No unsolicited DMs. Do not DM other users for help regarding programming.<br>
    The Mods cannot moderate DMs. It is better for your learning to have as many
    eyes on the problem as possible, and silent others may benefit from your
    questions’ answers.

    _Note: you are always welcome to message the Mods for any server-related
    issues._

13. If you are a student, we will follow academic honesty guidelines and refrain
    from helping where would be unethical for us to do so, such as on homework
    or exams. In the same vein, we will not provide help for ongoing
    competitions that forbid seeking outside help.

14. Ask specific questions about your issue, and respect that everyone in this
    server is a volunteer. We are not servants who will write your programs for
    you, so we will refrain from helping people who expect spoonfeeding.

15. Some channels have additional rules, specified below.

- These rules are not up for personal interpretations. There are no loopholes
or technicalities. Mods enforce these rules according to the spirit of these
rules, and arguing that some bad behavior is not covered by these rules may
lead to a kick/ban.

## #security channel

1. We do not help and we will immediately stop helping anyone judged to be
   pushing any legal boundaries or trying to circumvent any entity’s Terms of
   Service.

2. No pentesting any other entity’s system.

3. If you are not sure that something is malicious, assume it is by default.

4. If you want help with something that could potentially be used maliciously,
   it is on you to demonstrate exactly how you are using it and why your
   use-case is not malicious.

5. Breaking any of these #security rules will get you banned from this channel
   on first offense.

## #hire-people channel
 
- Every listing in #hire-people will adhere to these minimum requirements: 

1. A functional link to an official job posting without link shortening (we
   make allowances here for peer-to-peer gigs, but a link is preferred),

2. A specific, numeric budget or salary range that is neither 0 nor insultingly
   low.

3. The name of the person or company soliciting the position,

4. The work location or if remote is an option

5. Whether visa sponsorship is available,

6. Whether the position is direct-hire or contract,

7. Not be a request for an academic integrity violation or a subcontract,

8. Do not write "DM if interested." Respond to questions on the server. 
  Your post implies that they can DM you if they choose to.

- **Job posters**: Any post that does not conform to these rules will be removed
and the poster will be warned/disciplined as appropriate. Keep in mind that
these are minimum requirements. You are encouraged to exceed them.

- **Job seekers**: Remember to protect yourself. The server is not liable if you
get scammed, but you are encouraged to come forward to a Mod if a job poster
is dishonest. We will definitely discipline them as appropriate.
Additionally, in this context, personal information should be exchanged via DM.

## Forms of punishment

1. **Informal warning:** Warning of potential breaking of the rules in chat,
   usually kept between a Mod and a user. Intended as a precaution.

2. **Formal warning:** Same as above, but will be logged for consideration
   before future punishments. There is no formal number of warnings required
   before more serious punishment.

3. **Kick:** The user is expelled from the server, but they are free to return.
   Kicks will only be issued once per user.

4. **Temporary ban:** Expulsion for a set period of time. Duration of the ban
   is at the Mod’s discretion.

5. **Permanent ban:** Permanent ban. Applied when the breaking of the rules is
   too extreme or after several repeated offenses.

- All of the disciplinary actions above can be appealed. Speak with a Mod
after a change of heart, or after careful consideration if you wish to
accuse a Mod of abuse.

## Helpers

1. The Helper role is for users who are active, helpful, and mature in our
   community.

2. There are no knowledge or skill requirements to be a Helper.

3. Each Helper’s specialties are listed in #help-directory.

4. Helpers are under increased scrutiny to uphold to our rules. Continued
   bending of the rules or modeling poor behavior will result in removal from
   the Helpers.

5. If you want to be a Helper, send a DM to @devoidfury to ask. Helpers may
   also nominate people that they are interested in obtaining the role. The
   role is voluntary and can be abandoned at any time.

## Mods
 
1. The Mods are the managers of the server and they enforce the rules.

2. The Mods may be contacted at any time via DM to discuss issues with anything
   or anyone on the server.

3. Do not ask to become a Mod. Promotion is an internal decision by majority
   vote. The role is voluntary.

4. If you disagree with the actions of a Mod, first take it to that Mod’s DMs.
   You may follow up with another Mod if you still feel unsatisfied.

## Too Long; Didn't Read

- Be nice. Be mature. Follow the law. Listen
to the mods. Ask your question directly (*don't ask to
ask*) and don't post across multiple channels or ask
people for programming help in DMs.
