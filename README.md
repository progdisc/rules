## Too Long; Didn't Read

- Be nice. Be mature. Follow the law. Listen to the mods. Ask your question
  directly (*don't ask to ask*) and don't post across multiple channels. Don't
  ask people for programming help in DMs.
- For more information, visit <https://progdisc.club>

## Rules

1. Follow the Discord service guidelines: <https://discord.com/guidelines>

2. This is a welcoming community. All forms of abuse, belittlement, and
   rudeness are strictly forbidden. This includes unsubstantiated
   language/technology bashing, unprompted aggression, and anything unpleasant
   that someone else asks you to cease.

3. Memes and shitposts are not allowed outside of #off-topic, and they are
   discouraged in general. Excessive meme/shitpost spam will lead to a kick/ban.

4. Everyone on this server is a volunteer. We forbid monetary offers.

5. We do not help with breaking the law or breaching any software, API’s or
   Terms of Service. The following are prohibited, do not ask for help with:
   sniper bots, shopping bots, ticket bots, sneaker bots, multiplayer game hacks,
   keyloggers, botnets, phishing, viruses or other malware.

6. Do not post or discuss NSFW/NSFL or illegal content (this includes
   nicknames).  Do not post or discuss piracy content. Do not post or discuss
   political content.

7. No advertisement (invite links, referral links, etc.) unless explicitly asked,
   in which case links can be sent through personal messages.

8.  No unsolicited DMs. Do not DM other users for help regarding programming.<br>
    The Mods cannot moderate DMs. It is better for your learning to have as many
    eyes on the problem as possible, and silent others may benefit from your
    questions’ answers.

    _Note: you are always welcome to message the Mods for any server-related
    issues._

9.  If you are a student, we will follow academic honesty guidelines and refrain
    from helping where it would be unethical for us to do so, such as exams or graded 
    class assignments (homework is allowed within reason). In the same vein, we will
    not provide help for ongoing competitions that forbid seeking outside help.

10. Some channels have additional rules, specified below.

- These rules are not up for personal interpretations. There are no loopholes
or technicalities. Mods enforce these rules according to the spirit of these
rules and arguing that a certain behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the rules 
may lead to a kick/ban.

- We reserve the right to kick or ban anyone for any reason. If we feel you're being
disruptive or a detriment to the culture of the server, we will remove you.

- All disciplinary actions can be appealed. Speak with a Mod after a change of heart,
  or after careful consideration if you wish to accuse a Mod of abuse.

## How to ask a question

1. Post your questions directly if you want help, without fear. Please do not ask
   questions like "Does anybody know about X?", "Is #channel alive?", "Can anybody
   help me?". Everyone can see all messages in all channels and lack of new messages
   in a channel doesn't mean it's "dead" or "inactive".

2. Please try using a search engine before asking your question. While we try
   to help everybody with whatever their question is, there are many answers on the
   Internet and you may not need live help.

3. Ask specific questions about your issue, and respect that everyone in this
   server is a volunteer. We are not servants who will write your programs for
   you, so we will refrain from helping people who expect spoonfeeding.

4. If you are having trouble deciding which channel to post in, choose whatever
   is closest. We are lenient about channel separation because everyone is in
   every channel.

5. Post your question in one and only one channel before waiting for a
   response.<br>
   Cross posting will not get you an answer sooner, and it will split the
   discussion into redundant and/or conflicting answers. Directing people to
   your question is a better strategy than reposting it.

## #security channel

1. We do not help and we will immediately stop helping anyone judged to be
   pushing any legal boundaries or trying to circumvent any entity’s Terms of
   Service.

2. No pentesting any other entity’s system.

3. If you are not sure that something is malicious, assume it is by default.

4. If you want help with something that could potentially be used maliciously,
   it is on you to demonstrate exactly how you are using it and why your
   use-case is not malicious.

5. Breaking any of these #security rules will get you banned from this channel
   on first offense.

## Job Seekers and Job Posters

## Helpers

1. The Helper role is for users who are active, helpful, and mature in our
   community.

2. There are no knowledge or skill requirements to be a Helper.

3. Each Helper’s specialties are listed in #help-directory.

4. Helpers are under increased scrutiny to uphold to our rules. Continued
   bending of the rules or modeling poor behavior will result in removal from
   the Helpers.

5. If you want to be a Helper, send a DM to @devoidfury to ask. Helpers may
   also nominate people that they are interested in obtaining the role. The
   role is voluntary and can be abandoned at any time.

## Mods

1. The Mods are the managers of the server and they enforce the rules.

2. The Mods may be contacted at any time via DM to discuss issues with anything
   or anyone on the server.

3. Do not ask to become a Mod. Promotion is an internal decision by majority
   vote. The role is voluntary.

4. If you disagree with the actions of a Mod, first take it to that Mod’s DMs.
   You may follow up with another Mod if you still feel unsatisfied.

5. **Don't ping @Mods unless there's an emergency**, e.g. someone spamming or
   posting/talking about inappropriate content. Remember that we're
   all volunteers, and mass pinging won't get you help any faster, it'll
   only come off as disrespectful.
